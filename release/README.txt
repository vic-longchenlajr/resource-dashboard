  - Data is stored in your browser's local
    database (IndexedDB). Clearing browser
    data will erase imported timesheets.

  - If the browser doesn't open, manually go
    to http://localhost:4173

    "Stop Dashboard.bat" first, then try again
  - Make sure you're using a modern browser
    (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
